# Express Calculator

This is a simple calculator web application built using Express.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set the environment variable `PORT` to the port you want the server to run on. If you don't set this, the server will run on port 3000 by default.

#### Sample .env file
```
PORT=3001
```

## Usage

1. To start the server, use `npm start`.
2. To run the tests, use `npm test`.
3. You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the API endpoints at `http://localhost:<PORT>` (PORT will be 3000 by default if you have not defined it in the .env file).
4. To view the documentation, after starting the server, go to `/docs` in your browser. You can also make API calls from this documentation page.
